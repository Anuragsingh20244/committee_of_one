Committee of One

A psychological strategy game where you influence a town's collective mind from the shadows.

🎮 The Game

You are the unseen consciousness guiding a small town. Through subtle influence, you shape thoughts, spread emotions, and manipulate citizens' subconscious minds. But be careful—too much control can lead to chaos, too little can cause collapse. Maintain the delicate balance of stability.
